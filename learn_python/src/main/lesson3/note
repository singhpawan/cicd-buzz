3.1: File and String basics


f = open('portfolio.csv', 'r')
f.close()

It's common to open and close the file and closing of file is important for the operating system.
There is something else we can do is use the with context.

Text manipulation to cleanup the data, extract the data.

f = open('portfolio.csv', 'r')
data = f.read() # grabs the entire file and puts it into a text string.
print(data) # looks more like the original file.
for line in data:
  print(line)

line

f.close() # is important for os and is easy to forget.


There is a common operation involving files
1. open file 2. Do some operations 3.Close the file.

The more modern way is to use the with statement

with open('portfolio.csv', 'r') as f: # with statement establishes the context and closes the file when done.
  data = f.read()

a = 'hello world'
b = "hello world"

treat it like array of characters

a[0]
a[1]
a[-2] : second to the last

a[0:5]
a[:5]
a[-5:]

len(a)

c = 'hello'
d = 'world'

c + d
'helloworld'

line.strip() # gets rid of white spaces

if you do anything to the string, you have to save the string.
if you have to save the result you need to print into the variable.

line.replace('"', '-')

parts = line.split(',')
parts[0] = parts[0].strip('"')

parts[2] * parts[3] # cant's multiply the string

parts[2] = int(parts[2])
parts[3] = int(parts[3])

## Be on the lookout for standard library modules.
