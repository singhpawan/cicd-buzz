# is a comment

Python comes from a scripting language and executes line by line.

python doesn't require you to declare data type.

Can't start a variable name with a digit.

While loop execute everything under the indentation and it's knows it
ends when the next line is not under the indentation.

principal = 500000
payment = 3873.34
rate = 0.05
total_paid = 0

while principal > 0:
  interest  = principal*(rate/12)
  principal = principal + interest - payment
  total_paid += payment

print('Total paid', total_paid)

# usually program are indentation with 4 spaces (don't use tab)
